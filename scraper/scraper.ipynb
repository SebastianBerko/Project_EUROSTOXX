    "Stats and ratios are downloaded using two functions from yahoo_fin package. Unfortunately, it seems that yahoo finance is provides less maintanance and information on european stocks, as opposed to stocks listed on NYSE or NASDAQ. As a result of that, Yahoo Finance sometimes does not keep financial ratios for European stocks during closed exchanges, but instead, the ratios are shown to be N/A (unlike US stocks, where the values are always shown, even if they do not change during closed exchanges). This caused issues with our code, since the loop could not match ticker with respective data from yahoo finance. We solved this by using try: except: pass. However, for best performance of the code, we recommend using it during open exchanges, since code will omit every ticker, which does not have available information."
